# YOUTUBE-TRANSCRIPT-SUMMARIZER

Overview
YouTube Transcript Summarizer is a Flask-based backend solution for summarizing YouTube video transcripts. The API is designed to process well-formatted closed captions available in YouTube videos and return concise text summaries. This project also includes a web version of the summarizer for easy use.

Created in 2020: A stepping stone in exploring Flask and text summarization—remembering the journey from where it all began!

Features
Processes transcripts from YouTube videos with properly formatted closed captions.

Summarizes text efficiently using back-end API calls.

Includes a web interface for accessing the summarizer.

Technologies Used
Framework: Flask

Languages: Python

Other Tools: Web hosting for the summarizer

Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash
git clone <repository-link>  
Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Application
Navigate to the project folder and execute:

python app.py  
The application will be hosted locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

How It Works
The backend receives API calls from the client containing the YouTube video URL.

Extracts and processes the closed captions available for the video.

Applies summarization logic to return a concise text summary.

Outputs the summary either via the API response or through the web interface.

Limitations
Works only on videos with well-formatted closed captions.

The summarization logic may depend on the transcript's quality and formatting.

Future Scope
Expanding support for multilingual captions.

Integrating additional NLP techniques for improved summarization.

Enhancing the web version with modern UI frameworks.
